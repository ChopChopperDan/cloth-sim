C++ Bullet Simulation of Cloth hosted by Robot Raconteur

This software is an implementation of the Bullet btSoftBody package aimed to simulate the physics of a rectangular
patch of cloth pinned at all four corners.  Each corner is fully controllable without affect by the surrounding physics.

Depends on bullet packages: BulletDynamics, BulletCollision, BulletSoftBody, and LinearMath

Depends on RobotRaconteur-0.5-testing https://robotraconteur.com/ and boost-1.55  http://www.boost.org/
